      <h1>Welcome!</h1>

      <p>Currently working as the development team leader in a fast-paced work environment. 
        We are an 800-employee contact center that is working with a broad range of clients, 
        including 4 major banks and leaders in the insurance industry. <br>
        Due to our varying clientele we offer systems on request. We do not limit requests 
        to any specific platform and are open to develop and integrate specifically to 
        clientsâ€™ needs and systems. As a result, the scope of my skillset has become 
        very broad, incorporating many different systems and frameworks. <br>
        The developers in my team need to be focused on multiple projects simultaneously 
        so the real challenge is building a modular and flexible function base to support 
        the business model. 
      </p> 

      <h3>Skillset</h3>

        <p>I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I
          could plan for it... I'm sure something will pop into my head here in
          the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to
          come up with answer, but it hadn't yet...</p>

        <p>I don't want to sound like
          I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't - you
          just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet
          as I should be in coming up with one.</p>
